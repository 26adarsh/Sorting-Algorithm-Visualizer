# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a visual representation tool for sorting algorithms. Using a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI), users can visualize how different sorting algorithms work on an array of data. The visualizer supports the following algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

## Features

- **Dynamic Visualization:** Watch the sorting process step-by-step with real-time updates.
- **Algorithm Selection:** Choose from various sorting algorithms to see how they differ in performance and behavior.
- **Customizable Input:** Generate arrays with custom sizes and value ranges.
- **Speed Control:** Adjust the speed of the visualization to better understand each step of the algorithm.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/26adarsh/Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer.git
   cd Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer

2. **Install Dependencies:**
Make sure you have Python and Tkinter installed.
    
## Usage

1. **Run the Application:**

- Open your Python IDE (e.g., VS Code).
- Go to Run -> Start Debugging -> Current File.

2. **Using the GUI:**

- Select an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
- Adjust the size, minimum value, and maximum value of the array.
- Use the "Generate" button to create a new random array.
- Set the visualization speed using the speed scale.
- Click "Start" to begin the sorting visualization.
